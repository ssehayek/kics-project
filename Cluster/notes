###<density-test>

Variation of prob_place, which controls the density of immobile particles. High density simulations should be poorer since fluctuations are lower.
Aggregates also have low fluctuations because they consist of a locally dense population.

Interesting observation: fitting 10 time lags, as opposed to 5, in the k_on=0.4, k_off=0.5 simulations gives poorer results.

###<consistency-test>

Running multiple runs with same parameters to check if there is consistency in the fits.

2016-01-26
- Parameters are not consistent, pointing to possible degeneracy.
- Runs so far have been done on 64x64 px. grid, trying 5 runs of 128x128 px. grid
2016-01-29
- Results may be better for 128x128 px. grid

###<no-aggregates-test>

Runs with "prob_agg" set to 0, to get unclustered filaments.

2016-01-29
- Not looking any better. Problem may lie with fit function
